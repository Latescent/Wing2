# --- General Paths ---
# Path to the source directory containing all raw images for analysis.
data_dir: "data/raw_sample/" # <-- IMPORTANT: Set this to your main data folder.

# Path for all generated output. Each script will create a sub-folder here.
output_dir: "output/"

# Method-Specific Parameters
# ===================================================================

# --- Hierarchical Clustering ---
hierarchical_clustering:
  # The number of principal components to reduce the feature vectors to before clustering.
  # This helps speed up clustering and can improve results by focusing on the most significant variations.
  n_components: 50

  # The distance threshold used to form flat clusters from the dendrogram.
  # Any links in the hierarchy with a distance greater than this value will be cut.
  # This value requires tuning based on the dataset's characteristics.
  distance_threshold: 50.76

# --- DBSCAN Clustering ---
dbscan_clustering:
  # The maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as in the neighborhood of the other.
  # This is the most important DBSCAN parameter to tune.
  eps: 15.0

  # The number of samples (or total weight) in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point.
  # This includes the point itself.
  min_samples: 5

# --- Isolation Forest & Intersection Analysis ---
classification_analysis:
  # The proportion of outliers or anomalies in the dataset for the Isolation Forest model.
  contamination: 0.2

  # The area (in pixels) below which a contour is considered 'noise' during feature extraction.
  contour_area_threshold: 50

  # Parameters for the intersection-based outlier detection method.
  intersection_matching:
    # The minimum percentage of coordinates that must match for two image patterns to be considered similar.
    match_threshold: 0.8
    # The maximum distance (in pixels) between two intersection points to be considered a match.
    distance_threshold: 10
